//     Kmes has written three integers a,
//     b
//         and c
//             in order to remember that he has to give Noobish_Monk a×b×c
//                 bananas.

//     Noobish_Monk has found these integers and decided to do the following at most 5 times :

//     pick one of these integers;
// increase it by 1
//     .For example,
//     if a = 2, b = 3 and c = 4, then one can increase a three times by one and increase b two times.After that a = 5, b = 5, c = 4 .Then the total number of bananas will be 5×5×4 = 100 .

//                                                                                                                                                                                     What is the maximum value of a×b×c Noobish_Monk can achieve with these operations
//                                                                                                                             ?
